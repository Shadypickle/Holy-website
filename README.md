# Holy-website
this code is meant to replicate a experience you would have on a personal desktop and it should save everything you do on the website and load it back when you come back and everything you open the website in a split second it should redirect you instantly to a new website that has the content but the url is random so it can never be truly blocked and people can always share the new urls so there's constantly new ones.
